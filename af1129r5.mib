--    This is the MIB module for managing ATM
--     Emulated LANs as well as LAN Emulation
--     Configuration Server (LECS).  It provides 
--     mechanism for constructing and destroying 
--     ELANs, for distributing members of an

--     of an ELAN.  It also provides management

        ELAN entry in their repective tables.
        There are four memebers to an ELAN and

        of LECS is optional.  The addition and
