mpcNextIndex OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX Integer32(0..2147483647)
    ACCESS read-write
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "This object contains an appropriate value to
        be used for mpcIndex when creating entries in
        the mpcConfigTable.  The value 0 indicates that
        no new rows can be created.  Otherwise, it is
        recommended that values are assigned contiguously,
        starting from 1.
        
        MPC creation by a Manager:  To obtain the mpcIndex value
        for a new entry, the manager issues a management protocol
        retrieval operation to obtain the current value of this
        object.  If the value retrieved is 0 (zero), the manager
        cannot create a row.
        
        After each retrieval of a non-zero value, the manager
        should issue a management protocol SET operation using
        the value just retrieved.  If the SET is successful,
        the agent should update the value to the next unassigned
        index, or zero if appropriate.
        
        NOTE:  the manager may also issue a set on this object
        with a value of its own choosing.  If the set is successful,
        the manager may use this value for the mpcIndex. In this
        case, the agent would update the value to the next
        unassigned index, or zero if appropriate.
        The definition of `next unassigned index' is any
        mpcNextIndex value that has not yet been set by a manager,
        or reserved by the agent (see next paragraph), since this
        agent was last re-initialized.
        
        MPC creation by an Agent:  When a row in the
        mpcConfigTable is created by an agent, the agent should
        reserve the value of the index by updating the value of
        this object to the next unassigned index
        or zero if appropriate.  Thus, a manager will not
        be able to set an index reserved by an agent.
        
        In the situation of an agent re-initialization,  all currently
        used mpcIndexes must be preserved.
        In other words, the Agent should store in non-volatile memory
        all of the currently used mpcIndexes (along with all necessary
        configuration information from the mpcConfigTable).  When the
        agent is re-initialized, the mpcNextIndex value is
        any valid Integer32 value which is not being used
        as an mpcIndex, except 0 which maintains its original
        
        
        definition of indicating that a row cannot be created."

        An entry represents a specific MPOA Client's

        For example, the corresponding mpcConfigEntry contains
        default and/or configured parameters, if mpcConfigMode was
        
        
        set to manual, then these are the objects values' which are

        will be all the corresponding mpcConfigEntry's object,
        excluding any objects which were retrieved from the LECS.
        In other words, the objects retrieved from the LECS during
        the (re-)initialization of the MPC overwrite any of the default
        and/or configured values.
        NOTE:  any subsequent `set' to the configured values, e.g. an

        set operation, which is successful could result in a change to an

mpsNextIndex OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX Integer32(0..2147483647)
    ACCESS read-only
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "This object contains an appropriate value to
        be used for mpsIndex when creating entries in
        the mpsConfigTable.  The value 0 indicates that
        no new rows can be created.  Otherwise, it is
        recommended that values are assigned contiguously,
        starting from 1.
        
        MPS creation by a Manager:  To obtain the mpsIndex
        value for a new entry, the manager issues a management
        protocol retrieval operation to obtain the current value
        of this object.  If the value retrieved is 0 (zero), the
        manager cannot create a row.
        
        
        After each retrieval of a non-zero value, the manager
        should issue a management protocol SET operation using
        the value just retrieved.  If the SET is successful,
        the agent should update the value to the next
        unassigned index, or zero if appropriate.
        
        NOTE:  the manager may also issue a set on this object
        with a value of its own choosing.  If the set is successful,
        the manager may use this value for the mpsIndex. In this
        case, the agent would update the value to the next
        unassigned index, or zero if appropriate.
        The definition of `next unassigned index' is any
        mpsNextIndex value that has not yet been set by a
        manager, or reserved by the agent (see next paragraph),
        since this agent was last re-initialized.
        
        MPS creation by an Agent:  When a row in the mpsConfigTable is
        created by an agent, the agent should reserve the value of
        the index by updating the value of this object to
        the next unassigned index or zero if appropriate.  Thus, a
        manager will not be able to set an index reserved by an agent.
        In the situation of an agent re-initialization all currently
        used mpsIndexes must be preserved.  In other words, the Agent
        should store in non-volatile memory  all the currently used
        mpsIndexes (along with all necessary configuration information
        from the mpsConfigTable).  When the agent is re-initialized,
        the mpsNextIndex value is any valid Integer32 which is not
        being used as an mpsIndex, except 0 which maintains its
        original definition of indicating that a row cannot be created."
