NOTE-From the perspective of the Link Aggregation
mechanisms described in Clause 43, only a single
combination of Actor's System ID and System Priority are
considered, and no distinction is made between the
values of these parameters for an Aggregator and the
port(s) that are associated with it; i.e., the protocol
is described in terms of the operation of aggregation
within a single System. However, the managed objects
provided for the Aggregator and the port both allow
management of these parameters. The result of this is to
permit a single piece of equipment to be configured by
management to contain more than one System from the
point of view of the operation of Link Aggregation. This
may be of particular use in the configuration of
equipment that has limited aggregation capability (see
