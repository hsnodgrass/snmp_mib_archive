different network layer, transport layer, and higher-layer
protocols.  The agent should boot up with this table

the protocol distribution group), even for implementations
that don't support the application layer groups."

An example of the indexing of this entry is
protocolDirLocalIndex.8.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.2.0.0, which is the

protocolDirID OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX OCTET STRING
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "A unique identifier for a particular protocol.  Standard
identifiers will be defined in a manner such that they
can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e.
a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the
protocol encapsulation `tree' and which has algorithmic
assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees. See RFC XXX for
more details.

Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place
entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect.  In
other words, it need not populate this table with all of the
possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on
the fly when it sees them.  Whether or not it does these
things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit,
usability), and is up to the designer of the product.

If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that
the agent doesn't understand, either directly or
algorithmically, the SET request will be rejected with an
inconsistentName or badValue (for SNMPv1) error."

will be one octet in this string for each sub-identifier in
the protocolDirID, and the parameters will appear here in the
same order as the associated sub-identifiers appear in the
protocolDirID.

Every node in the protocolDirID tree has a different, optional
set of parameters defined (that is, the definition of
parameters for a node is optional).  The proper parameter
value for each node is included in this string.  Note that the
inclusion of a parameter value in this string for each node is
not optional - what is optional is that a node may have no
parameters defined, in which case the parameter field for that
node will be zero."

The value for each supported protocol must remain constant at
least from one re-initialization of the entity's network
management system to the next re-initialization, except that
if a protocol is deleted and re-created, it must be re-created
with a new value that has not been used since the last
re-initialization.

The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
entity. A protocolDirLocalIndex must not be re-used until the
next agent-restart in the event the protocol directory entry
is deleted."

protocolDirDescr OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX DisplayString (SIZE(1..64))
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "A textual description of the protocol encapsulation.
A probe may choose to describe only a subset of the
entire encapsulation (e.g. only the highest layer).

This object is intended for human consumption only.

This object may not be modified if the associated
protocolDirStatus object is equal to active(1)."

protocolDirType OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX OCTET STRING {

	addressRecognitionCapable(1)
	}
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol
directory entry.

The presence or absence of the `extensible' bit describes
whether or not this protocol directory entry can be extended




by the user by creating protocol directory entries which are
children of this protocol.

An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is
`ip.udp'.  The probe may automatically populate some children
of this node such as `ip.udp.snmp' and `ip.udp.dns'.
A probe administrator or user may also populate additional
children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this
table.  When a child node is added for a protocol for which the
probe has no built in support, extending a parent node (for
which the probe does have built in support),
that child node is not extendible.  This is termed `limited
extensibility'.

When a child node is added through this extensibility
mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and
protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent.

The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the
manager who is creating the new entry.

This object also describes whether or not this agent can
recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network
level protocol.  That is, while a probe may be able to
recognize packets of a particular network layer protocol and
count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize
the addresses in this protocol and to populate network layer
or application layer tables with the addresses in this
protocol.  If this bit is set, the agent will recognize
network layer addresses for this protoocl and populate the
network and application layer host and matrix tables with
these protocols.

Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply
values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent
with respect to this protocol.  Note that since row creations
usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these
bits will usually be set to zero."

	DESCRIPTION "This object describes and configures the probe's support for
address mapping for this protocol.  When the probe creates
entries in this table for all protocols that it understands,
it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have
the capability to perform address mapping for the protocol or
if this protocol is not a network-layer protocol.  When
an entry is created in this table by a management operation as
part of the limited extensibility feature, the probe must set
this value to notSupported(1), because limited extensibility
of the protocolDirTable does not extend to interpreting
addresses of the extended protocols.

If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe
will not perform address mapping for this protocol and
shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value.
If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe
supports address mapping for this protocol and is configured
to perform address mapping for this protocol for all
addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces.

	DESCRIPTION "This object describes and configures the probe's support for
the network layer and application layer host tables for this
protocol.  When the probe creates entries in this table for
all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to
notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the
nlHostTable for this protocol or if the alHostTable is
implemented but doesn't have the capability to track this
protocol.  Note that if the alHostTable is implemented, the
probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both
the nlHostTable and the alHostTable.

If the associated protocolDirType object has the
addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network
layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and
thus the probe will populate the nlHostTable and alHostTable
with addresses it discovers for this protocol.

If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe
will not track the nlHostTable or alHostTable for this
protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any
other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3),
the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable
for this protocol and is configured to track both tables
for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces.
If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe
supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this
protocol but is configured to not track these tables
for any control entries or interfaces.
Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to
supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in
the nlHostTable and alHostTable.

Note that since each alHostEntry references 2 protocol
directory entries, one for the network address and one for the
type of the highest protocol recognized, that an entry will
only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3)
for both protocols."

notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the
nlMatrixTables for this protocol or if the alMatrixTables are
implemented but don't have the capability to track this

the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in
the the both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the

If the associated protocolDirType object has the

thus the probe will populate both of the nlMatrixTables and
both of the alMatrixTables with addresses it discovers for
this protocol.

If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe
will not track either of the nlMatrixTables or the

An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth
