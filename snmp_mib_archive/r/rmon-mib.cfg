etherStatsDataSource OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX OBJECT IDENTIFIER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "This object identifies the source of the data that
this etherStats entry is configured to analyze.  This
source can be any ethernet interface on this device.
In order to identify a particular interface, this object
shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object,
defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface.
For example, if an entry were to receive data from
interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1.

The statistics in this group reflect all packets
on the local network segment attached to the identified
interface.

An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental
changes to the media of the interface have occurred and
necessitate an invalidation of this entry.  For example, a
hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced
by a token-ring card.  In such a case, if the agent has such

FCS octets).
This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of
10-Megabit ethernet utilization.  If greater precision is
desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets objects
should be sampled before and after a common interval.  The
differences in the sampled values are Pkts and Octets,
respectively, and the number of seconds in the interval is
Interval.  These values are used to calculate the Utilization
as follows:

Pkts * (9.6 + 6.4) + (Octets * .8)
Utilization = -------------------------------------
Interval * 10,000

The result of this equation is the value Utilization which
is the percent utilization of the ethernet segment on a
scale of 0 to 100 percent."

(FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a
bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment

Note that this definition of jabber is different
than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5
(10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2).  These
documents define jabber as the condition where any

jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms."
	::= { etherStatsEntry 12 }


etherStatsCollisions OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX Counter
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "The best estimate of the total number of collisions
on this Ethernet segment.

The value returned will depend on the location of the
RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section
10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a
station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if
three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A
repeater port must detect a collision when two or more
stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe
placed on a repeater port could record more collisions
than a probe connected to a station on the same segment
would.

Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering
10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3
defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
collisions.

Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax
segments to which the repeater is connected."

historyControlEntry.  This source can be any
interface on this device.  In order to identify
a particular interface, this object shall identify
the instance of the ifIndex object, defined
in  RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface.
For example, if an entry were to receive data from
interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1.

The statistics in this group reflect all packets
on the local network segment attached to the identified
interface.

An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental
changes to the media of the interface have occurred and
necessitate an invalidation of this entry.  For example, a
hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced
by a token-ring card.  In such a case, if the agent has such

	DESCRIPTION "The number of discrete sampling intervals

the media-specific table associated with this
historyControlEntry.
When the associated historyControlBucketsRequested
object is created or modified, the probe
should set this object as closely to the requested
value as is possible for the particular
probe implementation and available resources.  The
probe must not lower this value except as a result
of a modification to the associated
historyControlBucketsRequested object.

There will be times when the actual number of
buckets associated with this entry is less than
the value of this object.  In this case, at the
end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will
be added to the media-specific table.

When the number of buckets reaches the value of
this object and a new bucket is to be added to the
media-specific table, the oldest bucket associated
with this historyControlEntry shall be deleted by
the agent so that the new bucket can be added.

When the value of this object changes to a value less
than the current value, entries are deleted
from the media-specific table associated with this
historyControlEntry.  Enough of the oldest of these
entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their
number remains less than or equal to the new value of
this object.

When the value of this object changes to a value greater

sampled for each bucket in the part of the
media-specific table associated with this
historyControlEntry.  This interval can
be set to any number of seconds between 1 and
3600 (1 hour).

Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their
maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will
take into account the possibility of overflow in any of
the associated counters.  It is important to consider the
minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a
particular media type and set the historyControlInterval
object to a value less than this interval.  This is
typically most important for the 'octets' counter in any
media-specific table.  For example, on an Ethernet
network, the etherHistoryOctets counter could overflow
in about one hour at the Ethernet's maximum
utilization.

This object may not be modified if the associated
historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1)."

Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering
10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3
defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals

type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32, Counter32, Counter64,
Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled.

Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely
in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access
control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of
this object to identify only those objects that exist
in a particular MIB view.  Because there is thus no
acceptable means of restricting the read access that
could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the
probe must only grant write access to this object in
those views that have read access to all objects on
the probe.

During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is
not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error
must be returned.  If at any time the variable name of
an established alarmEntry is no longer available in the

corresponding to part of the filterPktData, the packet
will fail this data match.

(2) For each relevant bit from the packet with the
corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to zero, if
the bit from the packet is not equal to the corresponding
bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail
this data match.

(3) If for every relevant bit from the packet with the

bit from the packet is equal to the corresponding bit
from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this
data match.

The following two rules are then applied to every packet:

(1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the
corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if
the bit from the packet status is not equal to the
corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the
packet will fail this status match.

(2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the
corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the
bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding
bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail
this status match.

Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches
above have passed this status match.  In particular, a zero
length status filter will match any packet's status.

The value of the packet status is a sum.  This sum
initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum.
The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent
on the media type of the interface that this channel
is receiving packets from.

The errors defined for a packet captured off of an
Ethernet interface are as follows:

bit #    Error
0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error

For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).

As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object
will have other media-specific errors defined.

For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the
packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object,

reaches the size of the packet status.

bufferControlChannelIndex OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX INTEGER (1..65535)
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "An index that identifies the channel that is the
source of packets for this bufferControl table.
The channel identified by a particular value of this

	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "This object shows whether the buffer has room to
accept new packets or if it is full.

If the status is spaceAvailable(1), the buffer is
accepting new packets normally.  If the status is
full(2) and the associated bufferControlFullAction
object is wrapWhenFull, the buffer is accepting new
packets by deleting enough of the oldest packets
to make room for new ones as they arrive.  Otherwise,
if the status is full(2) and the
bufferControlFullAction object is lockWhenFull,
then the buffer has stopped collecting packets.

When this object is set to full(2) the probe must
not later set it to spaceAvailable(1) except in the
case of a significant gain in resources such as
an increase of bufferControlOctetsGranted.  In
particular, the wrap-mode action of deleting old
packets to make room for newly arrived packets
must not affect the value of this object."

	DESCRIPTION "Controls the action of the buffer when it
reaches the full status.  When in the lockWhenFull(1)
state and a packet is added to the buffer that
fills the buffer, the bufferControlFullStatus will
be set to full(2) and this buffer will stop capturing
packets."

bufferControlCaptureSliceSize OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only

For example, if a 1500 octet packet is received by
the probe and this object is set to 500, then only
500 octets of the packet will be stored in the
associated capture buffer.  If this variable is set
to 0, the capture buffer will save as many octets
as is possible.

This object may not be modified if the associated
bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1)."

bufferControlDownloadSliceSize OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "The maximum number of octets of each packet
in this capture buffer that will be returned in
an SNMP retrieval of that packet.  For example,
if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the
associated capture buffer, the associated
bufferControlDownloadOffset is 0, and this
object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket
object that contains the packet will contain only
the first 100 octets of the packet.

A prudent manager will take into account possible
interoperability or fragmentation problems that may
occur if the download slice size is set too large.
In particular, conformant SNMP implementations are not
required to accept messages whose length exceeds 484
octets, although they are encouraged to support larger
datagrams whenever feasible."

bufferControlDownloadOffset OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "The offset of the first octet of each packet
in this capture buffer that will be returned in
an SNMP retrieval of that packet.  For example,
if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the
associated capture buffer and this object is set to
100, then the captureBufferPacket object that
contains the packet will contain bytes starting
100 octets into the packet."

	SYNTAX INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "The requested maximum number of octets to be
saved in this captureBuffer, including any
implementation-specific overhead. If this variable
is set to -1, the capture buffer will save as many
octets as is possible.

When this object is created or modified, the probe
should set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted as closely
to this object as is possible for the particular probe
implementation and available resources.  However, if
the object has the special value of -1, the probe
must set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted to -1."
	::= { bufferControlEntry 8 }


bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "The maximum number of octets that can be
saved in this captureBuffer, including overhead.
If this variable is -1, the capture buffer will save
as many octets as possible.

When the bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object is
created or modified, the probe should set this object
as closely to the requested value as is possible for the
particular probe implementation and available resources.
However, if the request object has the special value
of -1, the probe must set this object to -1.

The probe must not lower this value except as a result of
a modification to the associated
bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object.

When this maximum number of octets is reached
and a new packet is to be added to this
capture buffer and the corresponding
bufferControlFullAction is set to wrapWhenFull(2),
enough of the oldest packets associated with this
capture buffer shall be deleted by the agent so
that the new packet can be added.  If the corresponding
bufferControlFullAction is set to lockWhenFull(1),
the new packet shall be discarded.  In either case,
the probe must set bufferControlFullStatus to
full(2).

When the value of this object changes to a value less
than the current value, entries are deleted from
the captureBufferTable associated with this
bufferControlEntry.  Enough of the
oldest of these captureBufferEntries shall be
deleted by the agent so that the number of octets
used remains less than or equal to the new value of
this object.

When the value of this object changes to a value greater
than the current value, the number of associated
captureBufferEntries may be allowed to grow."

Ethernet interface are as follows:

bit #    Error
0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
