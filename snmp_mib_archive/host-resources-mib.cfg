An entry shall be placed in the storage table for each
logical area of storage that is allocated and has
fixed resource limits.  The amount of storage
represented in an entity is the amount actually usable
by the requesting entity, and excludes loss due to
formatting or file system reference information.

These entries are associated with logical storage
areas, as might be seen by an application, rather than
physical storage entities which are typically seen by
an operating system.  Storage such as tapes and
floppies without file systems on them are typically
not allocated in chunks by the operating system to
requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't
appear in this table.  Examples of valid storage for
this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram
(for some architectures this is further segmented into
regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing
store for virtual memory (`swap space').

This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic for
`out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of
