The alignment of a frame is checked by the

packets do not end on an 8-bit boundary.
All packets contain a set number of bytes
and must end after a defined number of bytes.
Packets that do not end on a byte boundary
fail the alignment check.

Faulty components may be the cause of alignment
errors. Check the following:

Segment too long: Nodes at the far end of the
cabling system transmit, unaware that a station
at the other end has already gained control of
the medium by transmitting the first 64 bytes
of a frame.

Failing cable: Packet data traveling through
shorted or damaged cabling may become corrupt
before reaching the destination station.

Segment not grounded properly: Improper grounding
of a segment may allow ground-induced noise to
corrupt data flow.

Improper termination: If a cable segment is not
properly terminated, allowing the signal to be
absorbed upon reaching the end of the segment,
a partial signal will bounce back and collide
with existing signals.

Noisy cable: Interference or noise produced by
motors or other devices can distort the signals
and cause CRC/Alignment errors.

Deaf/partially deaf node: A faulty station that
cannot hear the activity is considered a deaf node.
If you suspect a deaf node, replace the NIC.

Failing repeater, transceiver, or controller:
Repeaters, transceivers, and controllers can
disrupt the network signal, transmit erroneous
signals on the wire, or ignore incoming packets.
Perform the following steps:

1.  If your NIC is continuously transmitting,
it causes erroneous signals, or 'jabber'.
Replace a jabbering transmitter to ensure
proper network performance.

2.  Check your hub or switch. This component

cpqNicIfPhysAdapterDeferredTransmissions OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX Counter
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "The number of packets deferred before transmission:
This counter contains the number of packets whose
transmission was delayed on its first attempt
because the medium was busy.  Packets involved
in any collisions are not counted.  Frames
that wait before transmission are counted.
This statistic will be incremented often during
normal operation on a busy network.

Deferred transmissions occur when the network
is extremely busy; so busy that the NIC did
not try to transmit.  High counts of multiple
collisions and excessive collisions also occur.

Deferred transmissions indicate that this segment
of the LAN is overcrowded.  Reduce the traffic
by reorganizing the LAN.  For example, if you
have 100 stations on one Ethernet bus, break it
into two Ethernet segments by adding a NIC to
your server.  In this way you can balance the
load by putting 50 stations on one segment and
50 on the other.  If a few isolated stations
create the traffic, put them on a separate segment."
	::= { cpqNicIfPhysAdapterEntry 24 }


cpqNicIfPhysAdapterLateCollisions OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX Counter
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "Late collisions may be a symptom of cabling
problems.  A late collision is one that occurred
64 bytes or more into the packet.

Late collisions may be an indication that a
segment is longer than allowed by the wiring
specifications.

A station will believe it has control of the
cable segment if it has already transmitted 64
bytes.  If another node at the far end of the
segment has not yet seen the packet, and transmits,
this packet will collide with the first
transmission after the first 64 bytes have been
sent.  Ensure that your segment length does not
exceed the maximum length allowed.

Because the location of cabling problems can be very
difficult to detect on an Ethernet network, you may
want to 'shorten' an Ethernet segment (remove portions
of the network to isolate problems) until the problems
are no longer seen, and then expand the network until
the problem recurs.

If this counter increments quickly in a short
period of time, it may mean that the network
card is running in half duplex mode, but your
hub or switch port is configured for full duplex
mode.  Compare your network card's configuration
with the port's configuration.

Late collisions are also included in other
collision-related statistics."

	SYNTAX Counter
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION "The number of packets aborted during transmission
due to excessive collisions: This counter contains
the number of packets that, due to excessive
collisions, are not transmitted successfully.
A station may attempt to transmit up to 16 times
before it must abort the attempt.  Once the abort
occurs, this counter increments.

If you see an increase in deferred transmissions
as well as excessive collisions, the network is
extremely busy and this segment of the LAN is
overcrowded.  Reduce the traffic by reorganizing
your LAN or adding a NIC to the server.  For example,
if you have 100 stations on one Ethernet bus, break
it into two Ethernet buses by adding a NIC to your
server.   In this way you can balance the load by
putting 50 stations on one bus and 50 on the other.

The carrier sense signal is an ongoing activity
of a data station to detect whether or not another
station is transmitting.  Carrier sense errors
are detected when a station transmits a frame and
does not detect its own signal on the wire.

If you receive carrier sense errors, check the
following:

Failing cable: Packet data traveling through
shorted or damaged cabling may cause a signal loss.
Ensure that your cable is working and plugged in
properly.

Segment not grounded properly: Improper grounding
of a segment may allow ground-induced noise to
interrupt the signal.  Ensure that you have
properly grounded all segments.

Noisy cable: Interference or noise produced by
motors or other devices can interrupt the signals.

Deaf/partially deaf node: A faulty station that
cannot hear the activity is considered a deaf node.
If you suspect a deaf node, the network interface
card should be replaced.

Failing hub, switch, or controller: Repeaters,
switches and controllers can disrupt the network
signal, transmit erroneous signals on the wire,
or ignore incoming packets.  Perform the following
steps:

1.  Swap out the adapter, adapter cable, and
adapter attachment point, one at a time.
If you find a faulty component, replace it.
