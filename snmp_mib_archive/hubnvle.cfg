each managed repeater, the groups are uniquely
numbered in the range from 1 to
rptrBasGroupCapacity.

Some groups may not be present in a given repeater
instance, in which case the actual number of
groups present will be less than
rptrBasGroupCapacity. The number of groups present
will never be greater than rptrBasGroupCapacity.

Note:  In practice, this will generally be the
number of field-replaceable units (i.e., modules,

correspond to numbers marked on the physical
enclosure."

Each group is represented by a single bit. When
the value of a bit=1, it indicates that the group
represented by that bit is present in the
repeater; when zero, the group is not present.

Note:  The bitstring mapping text below does not
match the IETF conventions, and will be modified
appropriately.

The number of octets in the string is
rptrBasGroupCapacity divided by 8, rounded up to
the next whole number of octets.  For example, if
rptrBasGroupCapacity is 12, the octet string
returned by the agent will be of length two.

The first octet will encode the configuration of
groups 1-8, where group one is represented by the
least significant bit of the octet.  The second
octet will likewise encode groups 9-16.  In
general, octet i encodes groups (8i-7) through
(8i), where (8i-7) is represented by the least
significant bit and (8i) by the most significant
bit of the octet."

port. A disabled port neither transmits nor
receives.  Once disabled, a port must be
explicitly enabled to restore operation. A port
which is disabled when power is lost or when a
reset is exerted shall remain disabled when normal
operation resumes.

The admin state takes precedence over auto-
partition and functionally operates between the
auto-partition mechanism and the AUI/PMA.

Setting this variable to enabled(2) enables the
port and exerts a BEGIN on the port's auto-
partition state machine.

Note:  What the above means is that when a port
becomes disabled, its current auto-partition state
is frozen until the port is next enabled. When the
port becomes enabled, the auto-partition state
becomes notAutoPartitioned, regardless of its
pre-disabling state. This text will be clarified
in the next draft."

transmit Runts to its other ports, or propagate a
collision (which may be late) back to the
transmitting DTE and damaged frames to the rest of
the network. Such shortEvents are not a feature of
normal network activity. Also it should be noted
