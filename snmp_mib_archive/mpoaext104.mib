-- cnMpoaIpVerification Group
--
-- This group is implemented to provide security features that are
-- inherently lacking in the MPOA specification.  The security
-- is provided using a table of IP addresses that limits the 
-- IP addresses serviced by the MPOA Client (MPC).  The table is
-- either an inclusion or exclusion list that allows or dissallows
-- MPOA shortcuts for the identified range of addresses.

		the status and download object and the IP verification
		table.  Any change made to this object must be downloaded to
		the switch cards using the cnMpoaIpVerificationTableDownload
		object before the settings actually take effect. 
		
		To enable a verification table, the table type must be set 
		to exclusion or inclusion, enabled using the table status 
		object and then downloaded to the cards using the download 
		object.  
		
		To delete the IP verification information, you must set 
		the table status object to clear and then downloaded to 
		the cards using the download object.  When the information
		is deleted, the table type is read as unknown.
		
		To change the table type between exclusion and inclusion,
